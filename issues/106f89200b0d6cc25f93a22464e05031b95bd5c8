comment: Now we have revert confirmation
description: "Add per file revert buttons to the diff/commit page\r\nBetter yet, checkboxes,\
  \ and the ability to revert or commit just the checked files - Using jquery, we\
  \ should click the whole diff and use color for checked or not checked.  (in the\
  \ html is checkboxes, jquery hides them and does the clicking interface) at the\
  \ top, select all, select none, then commit or revert"
