Release Schedule
================

0.2 Crawling Crawfish
---------------------
This is going to be the first usable version of DVDev.  It will only be usable
as a development tool, not yet for project hosting.  As such, the commmand line
tools need to be in place, but the web based dashboard and merging won't be
finished.

0.3 Limping Lemur
-----------------
This will be the first version of DVDev usable for project hosting.  The
multi-user story will be completed, as will the xxx.  It is not expected to be
pretty yet.

0.4 Stumbling Stork
-------------------
This is the first general release of DVDev.  It will have a polished UI and at
least two themes, the default user theme, and the theme used by the DVDev.org
website.

0.5 Walking Wallabee
--------------------
A version to be proud of.  Rich project management, and better visualizations.
