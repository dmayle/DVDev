Running DVDev on Dreamhost
==========================

Running DVDev on a Dreamhost shared hosting plan requires some extra work to
get going.  Because of Apache restrictions, and certain file permission
defaults, we have to perform some extra steps to get running.


Creating a Private Python Environment
-------------------------------------

Because DVDev depends on software that is not already installed, or sometimes
installed with a conflicting version, we need to create a private Python
environment. The two most common ways of handling this are compiling your own
Python, pointing it to your own install and lib directories, and using
virtualenv to simulate the same thing.  As virtualenv is by far the easier of
the two routes, it's the method we'll use here.
